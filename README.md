# AI-knapsackProblemUsingGeneticAlgorithm
It's a problem that we have some car with diffrent cost and value and we have to choose the best ones to get most value with our money.
I solved this problem with Genetic algorithm of AI. The size of population is 10 and each one has n genes that are the cars number.
the genes changes randomly in 100 generation and at the end we got the answer.
